<p style= "color: #A9A9A9"> <em>"Det har jag aldrig provat förut, så det klarar jag helt säkert!"</em> - Pippi Långstrump </p>


# Bio

I'd prefer to limit the biographical information about me that's available on the internet. 

But I'm friendly! Send an email and say hi if you're so inclined or you'd like a CV.


# Recommendations 

In the meantime, perhaps I might make some recommendations in sundry categories.

## Newsletters

- [Flight Club by Rosemary Mosco](https://newsletter.rosemarymosco.com/). 

- [Money Stuff by Matt Levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff)

- [Silver Bulletin by Nate Silver](https://www.natesilver.net/)

## Books

### Fiction

- *Guards! Guards!* by Terry Pratchett
- *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut

### Nonfiction

- [A Pocket Guide to Pigeon Watching](https://rosemarymosco.com/books/a-pocket-guide-to-pigeon-watching) by Rosemary Mosco

## Espanish

- Diana Uribe's [La Historia del Mundo](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/la-historia-del-mundo/id998521277).

## Francais

- [Le Monde Diplomatique](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/)

## Swedish

- Don't look at me for recommendations for things in Swedish! If you'd be able to read or understand it, you know the media environment better than me!

...

- Except though, Miriam Bryant is an excellent singer.

## Chinese

- *Zhuangzi*. I need to find a good translation to English, but it's delightfully absurd and thought-provoking. Zhuangzi is the guy who wasn't sure if he was a butterfly.


## Learning/Teaching

### Stats/Data Science

- Joseph Blitzstein's [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home). I wish I'd discovered this a decade ago. He's *so* good. The textbook is free online, the lectures are clear and entertaining, and there are even some solutions in the textbook so you can make your own problem sets.
- Are you an instructor teaching data/R and seeking an excuse to procrastinate with funny pictures that may make their way into your lectures? If so, check out [Allison Horst's artwork](https://allisonhorst.com/everything-else)

### Math for Economists

- [U Arizona's Math Camp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArizonaMathCamp). I wish someone had told me to go through this in the June before starting the PhD. Someone probably did. I wish I'd listened.


## Stuff

- **Tea**: I get teas from [Teasenz](https://www.teasenz.com/)

    - If you subscribe to their newsletter, wait for your tea of choice to drop 20%, and then buy 2kg in bulk for another 20% off, the price relative to quality is pretty close to what you could get in a reputable tea shop in China.
