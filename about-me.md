# About Me

I'd rather be a little mysterious about personal history and putting on the internet things that someone could use to answer security questions, but I'm friendly! 

Send me an email and say hi if you're so inclined.

Instead, how about some recommendations of things that I think make the world a wonderful place.

# On the internet

- If you feel fondness towards modern-day dinosaurs and appreciate quirkiness, you might enjoy [Rosemary Mosco's monthly bird newsletter](https://newsletter.rosemarymosco.com/). 

- R got you down? Or are you an instructor teaching data/R and you are seeking an excuse to procrastinate with funny pictures that may make their way into your lectures? Then check out [Allison Horst's artwork](https://allisonhorst.com/everything-else)

# Books

## Fiction

- If you like a rollicking good time, check out *Guards! Guards!* by Terry Pratchett.

## Nonfiction

- Rosemary Mosco's [A Pocket Guide to Pigeon Watching](https://rosemarymosco.com/books/a-pocket-guide-to-pigeon-watching) is a gem. Guaranteed to make you the person people don't know how to respond to at parties!

# Espanish

- Diana Uribe's [La Historia del Mundo](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/la-historia-del-mundo/id998521277) is a delightfully woven series. The way she uses the word *papayazo* embodies all that delights me about Colombian Spanish.

# Francais

- [Le Monde Diplomatique](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/) is my favorite media subscription. They write perspectives you just don't get in the States often, and the audio version is a pleasure on the ear.

# Swedish

- Don't look at me for recommendations for things in Swedish! If you'd be able to read or understand it, you know the media environment better than me!

...

- Okay, I lied. Miriam Bryant is an amazing singer. She's got some stuff in English, too. 

# Chinese

- Seriously, no, seriously, *Zhuangzi*. I need to find a good translation of this quirky Daoist genius, but he's so much fun and his stuff is so weird and thought-provoking.


# Learning Resources

## Math

- Joseph Blitzstein's [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home). I wish I'd discovered this a decade ago. He's *so* good. The textbook is free online, the lectures are delightful, and there are even some solutions in the textbook so you can make your own problem sets.

## Math Camp for Economists

- [U Arizona's Math Camp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArizonaMathCamp). I wish someone had told me to go through this in the June before starting the PhD.


# Stuff

- **Tea**: I get mine from [Teasenz](https://www.teasenz.com/) these days and my quality of life is so much higher. 

    - If you subscribe to the newsletter, wait for your tea of choice to drop 20%, and then buy 2kg in bulk for another 20% off, the price relative to quality is pretty close to what you could get in a reputable tea shop in China.
