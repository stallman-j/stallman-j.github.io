<p style= "color: #A9A9A9"> <em>"Det har jag aldrig provat förut, så det klarar jag helt säkert!"</em> - Pippi Långstrump </p>


# About

I'd rather not put on the internet things that someone could use to answer security questions or use to hot read me for a psychic stunt, but I'm friendly! 

Send me an email and say hi if you're so inclined.

Instead, how about some recommendations of fun and quirky things that make the world a little more pleasant to live in.

# Recommendations 

## On the internet

- If you feel fondness towards modern-day dinosaurs and appreciate quirkiness, you might enjoy [Rosemary Mosco's monthly bird newsletter](https://newsletter.rosemarymosco.com/). 

- R got you down? Or are you an instructor teaching data/R and you are seeking an excuse to procrastinate with funny pictures that may make their way into your lectures? Then check out [Allison Horst's artwork](https://allisonhorst.com/everything-else)

## Books

### Fiction

- *Guards! Guards!* by Terry Pratchett.

### Nonfiction

- Rosemary Mosco's [A Pocket Guide to Pigeon Watching](https://rosemarymosco.com/books/a-pocket-guide-to-pigeon-watching) is a gem. Guaranteed to make you the person people don't know how to respond to at parties!

## Espanish

- Diana Uribe's [La Historia del Mundo](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/la-historia-del-mundo/id998521277). Uribe is a delightful storyteller. Also a great resource if you're a little rusty on your Spanish and want something interesting that you can get some passive time listening to without getting too lost.

## Francais

- [Le Monde Diplomatique](https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/) writes perspectives you just don't get in the States often, and the audio version is a pleasure on the ear.

## Swedish

- Don't look at me for recommendations for things in Swedish! If you'd be able to read or understand it, you know the media environment better than me!

...

- Okay, I lied. Miriam Bryant is an amazing singer. She's got some stuff in English, too. 

## Chinese

- Seriously, no, seriously, *Zhuangzi*. I need to find a good translation of this quirky Daoist genius. His stuff is so weird and thought-provoking.


## Learning Resources

### Math/Stats

- Joseph Blitzstein's [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home). I wish I'd discovered this a decade ago. He's *so* good. The textbook is free online, the lectures are clear and entertaining, and there are even some solutions in the textbook so you can make your own problem sets.

#### Math Camp for Economists

- [U Arizona's Math Camp](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArizonaMathCamp). I wish someone had told me to go through this in the June before starting the PhD.


## Stuff

- **Tea**: I get mine from [Teasenz](https://www.teasenz.com/) these days, rather than pestering my pals to fill their suitcases.

    - If you subscribe to their newsletter, wait for your tea of choice to drop 20%, and then buy 2kg in bulk for another 20% off, the price relative to quality is pretty close to what you could get in a reputable tea shop in China.
