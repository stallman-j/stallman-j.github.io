# About Me


You won't find me on social media or LinkedIn. The biographical information on my CV is terse.

It's not that I have any profound secrets (although that's perhaps what someone *with* profound secrets would say, isn't it). It's just that I think privacy is a very valuable thing.

Sometimes I worry that my research style conflicts with the value I place on feeling free of surveillance.

For instance, I believe there's scope to use satellite monitoring to uncover things that can help improve people's lives, particularly where administrative data are scarce or unreliable. 

In that vein, I'm working on a project that tries to uncover the extent of cooperation over freshwater resources in Africa by examining satellite data.

If the infrastructure were like the United States, many more river systems would be metered and analyzed. The rights over freshwater resources also tend to be poorly defined, so it's not clear who *should* be getting the water in many cases.

Perhaps in the future, water managers could use satellite readings like this to get a sense of whether their water is being managed according to their prior agreements without needing to establish expensive monitoring systems.

But if we get good at reading how much water you're withdrawing, for instance, doesn't that knowledge accumulation also contribute to other, possibly less benign, uses of such satellite technology?

I don't have a good answer for that. But I think the question is worth asking.
