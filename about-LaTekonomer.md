LaTekonomer aims to provide those Overleaf/LaTex templates that it would be nice if someone else would make and maintain. 

The templates include but are not limited to to following:
    - general math writing
    - homework write-ups
    - article write-ups with bibliographies
    - professional but simple dark and light Beamer templates
    - tables (including three-part tables with footnotes)
    - figures
    - and a few research project assignments

The research project assignments come from ECON 412 International Environmental Economics, a course taught at Yale University by Sam Kortum, for which Jillian Stallman has been teaching assistant in Fall 2023 and Fall 2024.

Many of these tables and figures are outputs of code provided in the R package [**ekonomR**](https://github.com/stallman-j/ekonomR).  **ekonomR** and **LaTekonomer**  are designed to be complementary research templates, getting you moving forward on your project whether you're at the stage of tinkering with your final figure captions or figuring out what Overleaf even is. 

If you're starting a new project, you may also want to check out **ekonomR**. However, the use of **LaTekonomer** does not require **ekonomR** or vice versa.

LaTex isn't the only way to produce figures, tables, and commentary. The obvious competitor to a LaTex-based system is Markdown. 

If you're interested in exploring the Markdown world, check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/book/), which integrates sublimely with R and GitHub. This README, for instance, is composed with Markdown.
